  Immortalizing Laserwei's butthurt in this changelog:
	1. Ensured license notification was included stating which parts are MIT licensed and which aren't (reasonable).
	2. Demanding I changed the thumbnail, and threating copyright violation if I didn't (petty, but amusing).
	3. Genearlly being clearly mad that I called him a jackass, but thankfully he gracefully obliged a mountain of evidence that I was correct in my adjective choice.

Writing my name in any description or other notice is not enough to fulfill the MIT License. I wrote the specific things you have to do.
"Originally created by Laserzwei, who is too much of a jackass to be thankful for help."
Does not fulfill said criteria

The Title says it: Please remove the thumbnail. It doesn't show your changes and it's shameful copy-paste from my Mod (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/BigDrills).
I also forbid you to further share this picture without any official statement from me stating otherwise.
(The picture doesn't fall under the MIT License as it's only for the Software. So regular copyright laws apply)

I didn't see your awesome and creative "Originally created by Laserzwei, who is too much of a jackass to be thankful for help." When writing the 1st. Post. So as a reminder: Slightly modifying the picture is not enough
