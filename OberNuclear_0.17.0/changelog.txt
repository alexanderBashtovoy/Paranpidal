-v0.16.7
Changed refining ratios with help from Lordktor since most products that are required is petrol and then light oil. Decreased light oil from 50 -> 40 increased petrol from 65 -> 70
-v0.16.6
Fixed issue with recipes that have expensive and normal prototypes. Steel now has 1.2 productivity in both normal and marathon mode.
Boosted nuclear fuel production back up to 5 compared to 10 considering requirements for large bases.

-v0.16.5
Now should work with all mods ^-^
Nuclear fuel
1 u235 = 1.21gj

Uranium fuel cell
1 u235 = 10 cells or 14 with prod
1 cell = 8gj
1 cycle with +300% neighbor bonus = 4x
1 u235 = 14 * 8 * 4 = 448gj

370x more power per u235 than nuclear fuel.

Reduced uranium fuel output from 10 to 1
therefore this means its 37x more energy.

It also means that instead of 1 fuel cell crafter producing enough for 140 reactors.
It produces enough for 14 reactors... (with prod)

-v0.16.4

Added productivity to Oil

-v0.16.3

Made high temperature oil disabled by default (even though the recipe couldn't be used)

-v0.16.2

Changed Ratio of smelting from 4/3 (1.33) to 5/4 (1.25)
So that with productivity (1.5) ratio of iron to steel is 2 to 3.
