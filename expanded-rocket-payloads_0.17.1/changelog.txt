0.17.1
-made a couple code changes to make mod compatable with 0.17
-by request created new lab type building for the mod's science. Called the Data Processor.
  -researchable by its own tech
-added thumbnail for mod portal
-removed code that killed 'launched without satellite warning' since its no longer needed. 
-changed mod's first tech to be prerequisite on the space science pack tech instead of rocket silo. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0.16.8

-Reorganized the mod's recipe tab to be a bit cleaner and make more sense.
-Added code to prevent a crash
 -caused by different certain scenarios not having silo code the mod was requesting
-Fixed some spelling errors

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

0.16.7

Balance:
-Changed cost forumla for infinite techs. 
  -Getting basic bonuses from the first few techs will be largely the same as before, some more expensive.
  -For infinite techs instead of 1 extra data being needed for each new tech it will now be 2.
-Reduced output of Orbital Fabricator by half to a more sane value, base production should be 15k/min. 
  -Steel production made to be half that of Iron and Copper, base 7.5k/min
  -production will still be subject to speed modules
-Reduced cost of Space Shuttle and Telescope Shuttle refurbishment from 1000 rocket fuel to 500
-Reduced cost of Mining shuttle refurbishment from 2000 rocket fuel to 1000
-Because lab productivity is really powerful:
  -Lowered Lab productivity bonus per tech from 2% to 1%
  -Lowered Lab productivity bonus gained from Advance Space Station tech (100% -> 25%)
  -Lowered Lab productivity bonus gained from Orbital AI data core tech (200% -> 50%)
  -Lowered cost of Advanced Space Station tech from 500 to 400 data.

Other:
-Cleaned up some code in the shuttle refurbishment and repurposing recipies 
-Rearranged recipe ingredients and products into alphabetical order in the mod's code
 -this doesn't appear to have had an effect on their order for the in-game GUI
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0.16.6
-added mod's payloads to rocket silo stats gui
 -initiated by researching new tech Satellite Tracking
-minor graphics tweak to space telescope uplink
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0.16.5
-renamed Telescope Data to Satellite Data
-fixed collision box bug on Space Telescope Uplink entity
-added 2 fluid inputs for advanced assembler (north/south sides)
-enabled advanced assembler to craft items requiring fluids
-changed shuttle refrurbishment to require 20,000 water instead of 400 water barrels.
-Mining shuttle changes
 -Increased Iron production from 200k to 500k per launch
 -Increased Copper Production from 100k to 375k
  -minus launch costs it would take 50+ launches to get return on investment, this brings that down to ~17.
 -Mining shuttle refurbishment time increased from 480 seconds to 2400
  -holy crap musical_tanks that is 40 minutes!
  -no, its automatically cut in half by Advanced assembler 2x crafting speed
  -its still 25k iron per/min even before you beacon it
  -I expect you to speed beacon the crap out of it
  -I don't want whole bases run on 1 mining shuttle
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0.16.4
-completely rewrote the control.lua file to terminate the 'rocket launched without satellite' warning under several different circumstances:
 -when mod's first tech is researched
 -when a rocket is launched without satellite (for the next launch the message shouldn't show up)
 -when configuration changes (game updates, mods change, etc)
-changed around the readme file to clean it up and added this changelog at the request of several people
 -pre-release patchnotes removed
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0.16.3
-fixed many spelling errors in the locale file.
-changed around some descriptions to make more sense.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0.16.2
-changed file name of advanced probe graphic to ensure all letters were lowercase
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0.16.1 
-Initial release
