This work is an original production I scraped together from tutorials and looking at other mods to figure out how they worked, this includes SpaceX, Orbital Ion Cannon, Aidiakapi QOL research, Drone Swarm, Bob’s mods, Deep Mines, Useful Space Industry, Donny’s Fargodeep Mine and Factorio’s base game files (and probably other mods I have forgotten). 

Some elements of this mod do touch on areas other mods have attempted, namely asteroid mining and space power generation. I tried to make my mod work in different ways, for example orbital power generation in Dyson swarm and Useful Space Industry both are based off a script that counts each satellite launch and adds the total to a single ground receiving station. 

I made my mod without using such scripts, you launch a solar power satellite and you get one receiver station per satellite which generates power from that satellite. One reason I wanted to include these was for the completeness of the mod, also dyson swarm mod hasn’t been updated in several months and is a bit unbalanced in my opinion, and useful space industry hasn’t been updated in more than a year. 

I included asteroid mining because the asteroid mining mod hasn’t been updated for 0.16 and I wanted to use a reusable shuttle for it and to give players a way to generate resources late game without having to go crazy with outposts.

Thanks to /u/ulyssessword on reddit for the idea that helped make this possible! When I started out I was lost trying to code the rocket launch to directly buff laboratory productivity (which I don't think is even possible), Ulyssess suggested the space-lab launch produce a by-product that could be used in research which would allow the productivity bonus. This idea ended up being the basis for many of the mod’s features and saved me a lot of grief.

Some of the graphics in this mod were made by Richard at historicspacecraft.com. With his permission I used and modified them for their roles in the mod. These include the capsule used for station data, and the copper/iron dropships, all the shuttle variants (based off Dreamchaser), as well as the space lab component item. All from the International Space Station visiting vehicles image. Thanks Richard!

The Ground Telescope entity is based on a concept image for the Thirty Meter Telescope was modified by me for this project, found on Wikipedia. They request attribution so here it is: Courtesy of the TMT Observatory Corporation. 

All other images are edited versions from the public domain (NASA mostly) or from Factorio’s base game graphics, or combinations of the two. 

As far as licencing goes all code in this mod is covered under the MIT listening system. The graphics originally from historicspacecraft.com, even those modified by me are not under MIT. If you want to use them elsewhere I would recommend contacting Richard at that website.

Future plans:

Short term:
(done)-rescale infinite tech costs around base game resource cost scaling
(done)-balance output of ground fabricator so more than 1 is needed of any type.
-fix space fabricator requiring 5 orbital components
+any other bugs/balance issues that arise

Long Term
(WiP)-integration with bob's/angels (thanks SuperSandro2000 https://mods.factorio.com/mod/ERPTbaAB)
-expensive mode (mod settings?)
-space based radar
-More features relating to oil and petrochemical byproducts
