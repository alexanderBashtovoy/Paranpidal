[entity-description]
locomotive=Top speed 216.0km/h\nCan be refitted for more traction or higher speed.
heavy-locomotive=Top speed 205.2km/h\nAccelerates even very heavy trains quickly to top speed. Can replace 2 base locomotives.
express-locomotive=Top speed 302.4km/h\nBest used over long distances. Burns through fuel nearly twice as fast as base locomotives.
nuclear-locomotive=Top speed 259.2km/h\nRefitted to run on nuclear fuel cells.\nDestruction causes nuclear explosion.
cargo-wagon=Top speed 216.0km/h
fluid-wagon=Top speed 216.0km/h

[mod-setting-name]
train-overhaul-nuclear-loco-explosion=Nuclear locomotive explosion
train-overhaul-weight-multiplicator=Train weight multiplicator
train-overhaul-power-multiplicator=Locomotive power multiplicator

[mod-setting-description]
train-overhaul-nuclear-loco-explosion=True: (default)\nDestroying a nuclear locomotive triggers a nuclear explosion.
train-overhaul-weight-multiplicator=Higher weight will reduce acceleration and increase breaking distances.
train-overhaul-power-multiplicator=More power increases acceleration and fuel consumption, top speed is not affected.
